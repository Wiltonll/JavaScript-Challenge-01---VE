# JavaScript-Challenge-01---VE
This repository is part of a series of JavaScript challenges to challenge myself and improve my skills. 

This first challenge consists of:

"The Federation Officers' Academy needs your help to create a program that automates the calculation of student and class averages to better monitor their performance. This program will be incorporated into your main system, so you only need to develop the function that calculates the average. However, the function must be able to work with any number of students or classes."

Write a function that receives any number of integers as arguments and returns the arithmetic mean between them.
